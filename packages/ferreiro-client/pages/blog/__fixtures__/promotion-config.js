Thanks to Matt for giving me autonomy and encouraging and empowering me through those intense months building Studio. **Because you believed in my skills, I was able to grow a lot and even led some features in the project which helped my personal development**.\r\n\r\nI also want to thank my manager Brian Singer for believing in me from day one, as well as [Scott Stenback](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottstenback/) and Katie Harris for the initial conversations before joining Eventbrite. Brian, **your continuous feedback and help have been key to my growth and to seeing my blind spots**. I think we (the team) are so lucky to have you as a manager.
