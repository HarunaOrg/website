Start working on the presentation the night before the end of the hackathon. In a team of three or more, one of you can work full-time on the presentation. Then, start working really hard to practice the pitch.\r\n\r\n**How to sell your project**. Do not oversell or bullshit. You need to keep it realistic, while highlighting the cool stuff you built. I‚Äôve seen presentations with words like ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and ‚Äúblockchain,‚Äù but they really didn‚Äôt integrate those into their hacks. Some judges may be domain experts, so be prepared to answer technical questions!"

                    '**The perfect pitching structure**. As [Jake Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakehartmckinsey/) from McKinsey told me ‚ÄúMany teams spend two or three minutes to do a startup pitch, rather than showcasing the hack. They only dedicate the last minute to talk about the hack itself. I‚Äôd suggest hackers focus first on demoing their project first.‚Äù\r\n\r\nHere is a good structure to make your pitch:\r\n\r\n* üéØ Fifteen seconds to explain the problem.\r\n* üíª One minute and a half to demonstrate and explain the hack.\r\n* üí™ One minute to explain the challenges and lessons learned.\r\n* ü§î One minute for Q&amp;A.\r\n\r\n\r\nPitching is a key skill you will need to acquire. I can recommend several courses: [Introduction to Public Speaking.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/public-speaking) Coursera, Free. [Chris Anderson on Public Speaking.](https://www.udemy.com/course/chris-anderson-on-public-speaking/) Udemy. 45 euros. [Pitch your hackathon product in 3 minutes and conquer the jury](https://medium.com/next-media-accelerator/pitch-your-hackathon-product-in-3-minutes-and-conquer-the-jury-9f86bfbdba6f)\r\n\r\n## Hackathon Judges ‚Äì What Do They Evaluate?\r\n\r\nHackathon organizers generally create a rubric that contains the judging guidelines. While the evaluation criteria vary from one hackathon to another, there are some common patterns: UX/UI, technical complexity, the idea, and the lessons learned by the team.\r\n\r\n**What are the things I particularly value?** I pay a lot of attention to the idea‚Äôs originality, as well as the visual aspects of the projects. ‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words," so I appreciate well-crafted and beautiful interfaces that will help your team explain the idea better. (Free advice: try to team up with a good designer üòÅ) On the coding side, I love hacks that have solid technical solutions. Finally, I pay attention to how much learning the team did during the weekend.\r\n\r\n'

Jake from McKinsey agrees, and added he always asks himself, ‚ÄúHow hard is the thing they solved?‚Äù\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it‚Äôs hard to know the judging criteria. Build a project that you feel proud of. It‚Äôs great if you align your vision with the hackathon topic and context, but do not overthink creating the project you think judges want. Play freely and create something you will be passionate to demo and talk about.\r\n\r\n## Go Back Home and FollowUp with Hackers and Mentor\r\n\r\nAfter 36 hours of a roller coaster of emotions, it‚Äôs time to wrap up and come back home!
